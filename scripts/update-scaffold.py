update-scaffold.py - the myPKA scaffold updater.

WHAT THIS IS, IN PLAIN ENGLISH
==============================
This script updates the "framework" part of your myPKA folder (the parts we
ship and maintain: SOPs, Workstreams, Guidelines, templates, agent contracts,
the changelog, and so on) WITHOUT EVER touching "your" part (your notes, your
journal, your team's memory, your installed Expansions, your secrets, your
databases).

It can do this safely because the boundary between "ours" and "yours" is
written down as data in manifest.json:
  - framework_paths  = the files we MAY overwrite (ours, upgradable)
  - user_state_paths = the files we will NEVER touch (yours, sacred)

This script only ever writes inside framework_paths, and it refuses to write
anything that matches user_state_paths even if asked to.

HOW IT WORKS
============
1. It reads your LOCAL manifest.json (where you are now).
2. It reads a TARGET manifest.json (the new version you are updating to). You
   point at it with --target /path/to/new/manifest.json. (Fetching the new
   version from the internet is a separate concern; this script works on a
   target you already have on disk, so it is fully OFFLINE-SAFE.)
3. It compares the two and builds a plain-English plan: how many files are
   new, how many changed, and confirms that ZERO of your files are touched.
4. By default it only PRINTS the plan and changes nothing (a dry run).
5. It applies the changes only when you pass --apply.
6. Before it overwrites any framework file that YOU have locally modified, it
   first copies your version into .mypka/backups/<timestamp>/ so your edit is
   never silently lost.

WHAT IT WILL NOT DO
===================
- It will NOT touch anything under user_state_paths (PKM/, your journal,
  Team Inbox/, tasks/, session-logs/, Expansions/, .env, the databases).
- It will NOT update Expansion code (the cockpit and friends). Expansions are
  versioned on their own expansion.yaml and have their own updater. If your
  cockpit is behind, this script just tells you to run the cockpit updater.
- It will NOT reach out to the internet. (The boot-time version check is a
  different, tiny script: scripts/check-version.py.)
- It will NOT write a single byte in dry-run mode (the default).

This file is deliberately written with stdlib only (no pip, no npm) so it runs
on any machine with python3, with or without an LLM session.
