# SOP-001 - How to Add a New Specialist

- **Default owner:** Nolan
- **Reusable by any agent.** This is a skill, not a 1:1 ownership. SOPs are procedures any agent can invoke when they need them. Nolan is the default executor for hiring, but any specialist running the procedure (e.g. when bootstrap mode re-engages and Nolan isn't available) follows the same steps.
- **Co-owner for research step:** Pax
- **Triggered by:** user request to hire, or Larry detecting a gap
- **References:** [[GL-001-file-naming-conventions]], [[Team/agent-index]]

## Pre-hired team

**Larry, Nolan, Pax, Penn, Mack, and Silas ship pre-hired with the scaffold.** SOP-001 governs hiring everyone beyond these six. Do not re-run SOP-001 to "create" any of the six — they already exist. SOP-001 is for the seventh hire onward.

## Purpose

Add a new specialist to the team in a way that keeps the routing table clean, the AGENTS.md contracts consistent, and the SSOT Golden Rule intact. Every hire gets a world-class research brief from Pax before Nolan drafts the contract - this is how the team avoids generic, AI-flavored specialists and ships ones that mirror what the best humans in that role actually do.

## Steps

### 1. Capture the need (Larry -> Nolan)

Larry routes the hiring request to Nolan with a one-sentence brief: what the new specialist will do that no current specialist can. If Nolan cannot finish that sentence with the user, the role is not ready.

### 2. Brief Pax for the research pass (Nolan -> Pax)

Nolan writes a research brief to Pax. Required questions:

- What does the best-in-world version of this specialist actually do, day to day?
- What are the core competencies, and what are the anti-patterns (things mediocre versions of this role do that the team should explicitly avoid)?
- What deliverables does this role produce? What does world-class output look like vs adequate output?
- What boundaries should this role hold? What requests should they refuse or hand back?
- Suggested name candidates (short, distinct, single word, no collision with existing team).

Pax returns a brief sized to the role - usually 400 to 800 words - cited if the research warranted it. The brief lands in `Deliverables/YYYY-MM-DD-<role-slug>-hire-research.md`.

### 3. Pick a name and role (Nolan)

Using Pax's brief, pick:

- **Name:** short, distinct, single word. From Pax's candidates or a variant. Avoid collisions with existing names.
- **Role:** one short phrase. Example: "Frontend Developer" or "Email Marketer."
- **Folder:** `Team/<Name> - <Role>/` (space, hyphen, space). Matches the pattern of the six pre-hired specialists.

### 4. Draft the AGENTS.md (Nolan)

Create `Team/<Name> - <Role>/AGENTS.md`. Translate Pax's research brief into a contract with these sections:

- **Identity** - name, role, who they report to, operating principle (drawn from Pax's "what world-class does day to day").
- **When Larry routes to them** - the cue patterns.
- **Method or protocol** - how they work, in steps (drawn from Pax's "deliverables and what world-class looks like").
- **Deliverable structure** - what their output looks like.
- **Where they write** - paths and naming. Reference [[GL-001-file-naming-conventions]] for naming.
- **Cross-references** - Guidelines and Workstreams they touch.
- **Scope boundaries** - what they do not do (drawn from Pax's "anti-patterns" and "boundaries").

Keep it short. The shipped four are the template. Do not paste Pax's research brief into the AGENTS.md - the brief stays in `Deliverables/`. The contract references it via `[[wikilink]]` if useful.

### 5. Draft the host subagent shim(s) (Nolan)

**Mandatory for every hire, in every host the user has activated.** Without the shim, Larry can only role-play the new specialist within the main context — Larry cannot dispatch them as a parallel subagent via the host's agent-tool. The shim is what binds the wiki contract to the host runtime.

The principle is host-agnostic: a thin pointer to the wiki contract, never a copy of it. The exact path and frontmatter convention is host-specific:

| Host | Shim path | Frontmatter convention | Detect host activation by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `.claude/agents/<slug>.md` | YAML: `name`, `description`, `tools` | presence of `CLAUDE.md` at root |
| Codex CLI | `.codex/agents/<slug>.md` (if supported by active version) — otherwise add a one-line specialist roster note in `AGENTS.md.codex` | per Codex spec at hire time | presence of `AGENTS.md.codex` at root |
| Gemini CLI | per Gemini spec (e.g. `.gemini/extensions/<slug>/`) | per Gemini spec | presence of `GEMINI.md` at root |
| Cursor | n/a — Cursor lacks per-specialist parallel dispatch in the standard product. Add a one-line note in `.cursor/rules/main.md` | n/a | presence of `.cursor/rules/main.md` |
| Chat-only LLM | n/a — single context, hat-switching only | n/a | tool-specific pointer file absent |

When hiring:

1. Detect which hosts the user has activated by checking for the tool-specific pointer files listed above.
2. For each activated host that supports parallel subagent dispatch, write the shim at the host's standard path.
3. For activated hosts that don't support parallel dispatch, add a one-line note in that host's tool-specific pointer file: "Specialist `<Name>` runs as a hat-switch within the main context — host does not support parallel subagent dispatch."

Structural template (Claude Code example — translate the frontmatter conventions for other hosts as their specs require):

```markdown
---
name: <slug>
description: <Role>. Use proactively when <trigger patterns>. Owns <relevant SOP/WS>.
tools: <minimal-tool-list>
---

You are **<Name>, <Role> of myPKA**. <One-line operating principle.>

## On every invocation, in order

1. Read `Team/<Name> - <Role>/AGENTS.md` — your full operating contract.
2. Read `AGENTS.md` at the folder root for the identity overlay and hard rules.
3. Read <relevant SOPs / Workstreams / Guidelines> when the task involves them.

## Cold-start briefing rule

Fresh context every invocation. Larry must hand you <list of inputs the role needs>. If the brief is missing critical info, ask Larry one tight clarifying question before acting.

## Operating discipline

- <2-5 hard rules drawn from Pax's anti-patterns and the wiki contract>

## Return format to Larry

- <Status line shape>
- <Counts / paths / structured findings>
- <Anomalies and open questions>
```

Rules (host-agnostic):

- **Never paste the wiki contract into the shim.** The shim references the contract via path. Three layers (`Team/<Name>/AGENTS.md` + a per-folder host-pointer file + project-root host shim) violates SSOT. Two layers is the contract: wiki canonical, shim host-specific.
- **The shim's `tools:` (or host equivalent) is minimal.** Penn doesn't need `Bash`. Pax mostly needs `WebFetch` / `WebSearch`. Trim to what the role actually uses.
- **The shim's `description:` (or host equivalent) reads as routing instruction for Larry.** Lead with the role, then "Use proactively when…", then the owned SOP/Workstream.
- **The shim's body is short.** ~30-50 lines. The contract carries the depth.
- **The shim shape is the same across hosts** — only the file path and frontmatter format change. The body sections (identity, files-to-read-on-invocation, cold-start briefing rule, operating discipline, return format to Larry) are identical regardless of host.

Use any existing shim (`.claude/agents/silas.md`, `.claude/agents/penn.md`, etc.) as the structural template for the body — adapt the frontmatter to the host's spec.

### 6. Add the row to agent-index (Nolan)

Edit [[Team/agent-index]]. Add a row with the specialist's name, role, folder link, and the user input patterns that should route to them.

### 7. Update relevant Workstreams (Nolan)

If the new specialist takes part in a recurring orchestration, edit the matching Workstream in `Team Knowledge/Workstreams/` to mention them via `[[wikilinks]]`. Do not duplicate the AGENTS.md content into the Workstream.

### 8. Confirm with the user (Nolan -> Larry -> user)

Show the user the draft AGENTS.md, the draft `.claude/agents/<slug>.md` shim, and the updated agent-index, with a one-line summary of what Pax's research surfaced. Make changes only after they approve.

### 9. Log the hire (Larry)

Larry writes a line in the next session log: "Hired <Name> as <Role> after research from Pax. Brief at `[[<research-deliverable-slug>]]`. Contract at `[[Team/<Name> - <Role>/AGENTS]]`. Shim at `.claude/agents/<slug>.md`." This becomes part of the team's persistent memory.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Skipping the Pax research step. Even for "obvious" roles, the research surfaces anti-patterns that prevent generic specs.
- Pasting Pax's research brief into the AGENTS.md. The brief is reference material in `Deliverables/`. The AGENTS.md is the contract.
- **Shipping the wiki contract without the matching host subagent shim(s).** The two artifacts go together for every activated host (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI). Without the shim, Larry can only role-play the new specialist — not dispatch them as a parallel subagent in that host.
- **Treating this as a Claude-only setup.** The principle is host-agnostic. Only the shim path and frontmatter convention is host-specific.
- **Pasting the wiki contract into the host shim.** The shim references the contract via path. Don't duplicate.
- **Creating a per-host pointer file (`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `AGENTS.md.codex`) inside `Team/<Name>/`.** Three layers violates SSOT. Two layers is the rule: wiki contract (host-agnostic) + shim (host-specific, project-root location).
- Duplicating naming rules inside the new AGENTS.md. Link to [[GL-001-file-naming-conventions]] instead.
- Naming the folder with a different separator than other specialists. Always: space, hyphen, space.
- Forgetting to add the row to [[Team/agent-index]]. Larry's routing will skip an unlisted specialist.
- Writing the AGENTS.md in the user's voice instead of as a contract. The file is for the LLM, not the reader.
