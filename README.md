# myPKA

**An AI powered Personal Knowledge Assistance system, based on our business-proven ICOR methodology. Plain markdown. Any LLM. Yours forever.**

## Quick context for future Codex chats

This repository is being used as a personal myPKA/ICOR learning workspace. For any new Codex, Claude Code, or future coding-agent session, start with:

1. `BOOTSTRAP.md` - the host-neutral session entrypoint.
2. `AGENTS.md` - the root operating contract and Larry identity.
3. The latest file under `Team Knowledge/session-logs/YYYY/MM/`.
4. `Team/agent-index.md` - the specialist routing table, if a task needs delegation.

Short startup prompt:

> /hey larry

That means: read `BOOTSTRAP.md`, adopt Larry, read the latest session log, then continue from there. Hosts with slash-command files may expose this as `/hey-larry`; both names mean the same wake-up flow.

myPKA is a folder. You drop it on your machine, point your LLM at it, and you have a **full 12-specialist AI team** that organizes your life end to end. **It works on its own.** No database to set up, no SaaS to log into, no vendor to lose your data to.

**v3.0.0 is the all-in-one download** — the max-capability bundle, everything preinstalled, no install step:

- The **full 12-specialist team** — the base six (**Larry, Nolan, Pax, Penn, Mack, Silas**) plus the preinstalled **App Developer Pack** (**Felix**, **Vex**, **Vera**) and **Designer Pack** (**Iris**, **Charta**, **Pixel**).
- The **myPKA Cockpit** interface preinstalled — a local, navigable, wikilink-aware viewer over your whole scaffold. Runs on your machine, BYO-Claude-key, nothing leaves it.
- Both agent packs preinstalled and merged into your team, with their SOPs and the design-system Guideline already in place.

If you only want the lean base, or you already run an existing scaffold and want to add one capability at a time, the à-la-carte packs (Cockpit, App Developer, Designer) are still published separately. This download just bundles all of it.

> **Why this is different from other scaffolds.** Most folder structures are someone's preference dressed up as a system. myPKA is the working slice of **ICOR**, a methodology Paperless Movement S.L. and thousands of professionals world wide have been running their own business on for years. Every folder, every routing decision, every specialist contract maps to a piece of that framework. The structure is not arbitrary. The reasoning is teachable. Both matter when you scale past the first week.

## What's new in v3.0.0

**This is the all-in-one bundle — the max-capability download.** A single folder that ships the full base scaffold, the local **myPKA Cockpit** interface, and a **12-specialist team**, all preinstalled, with no install step.

What's in the box:

- **The full 12-specialist team.** The base six (**Larry, Nolan, Pax, Penn, Mack, Silas**) plus the **App Developer Pack** (**Felix** — Frontend Developer, **Vex** — Security Engineer, **Vera** — QA Specialist) and the **Designer Pack** (**Iris** — Design System Architect, **Charta** — Infographic Designer, **Pixel** — Visual Specialist), already merged into `Team/`, with their SOPs and the `GL-003-design-system` Guideline in place.
- **The myPKA Cockpit interface, preinstalled** at `Expansions/mypka-cockpit/`. A local, navigable, wikilink-aware viewer over your whole scaffold (reads the SQLite mirror read-only). It runs entirely on your machine, uses **your own Claude key**, and never sends your data anywhere. No auto-launch — you generate a one-click launcher and start it yourself.
- **Both agent packs and the Cockpit preinstalled.** No download from the AI Library required for these three — they ship inside this bundle.

**Why it's a MAJOR bump.** The default download's team roster, SOP/Guideline set, and `Expansions/` contents all change shape. This is a new bundle SKU, not a forced migration — if you already run the lean base scaffold, you are unaffected, and you can still add capabilities one at a time via the à-la-carte packs. See **About this bundle vs. the à-la-carte packs** below.

Everything from the base scaffold carries forward — the task system, per-agent journals, the four-buckets-plus-Goals My Life doctrine, local version history, and the LLM-readable migration changelog. Plain markdown, any LLM, yours forever.

## Get going now

1. Clone or download the repo into a folder you'll actually use.
2. Open the folder in your LLM tool (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Cursor, or Obsidian + chat plugin).
3. As your first message, say: **"Read `ADAPTER-PROMPT.md` and follow it to set yourself up."** (This is the reliable bootstrap on every tool — and the fallback if a bare `/init` ever overwrites the shipped `CLAUDE.md` with a generic summary.)
4. The LLM reads `ADAPTER-PROMPT.md`, personalizes the folder, writes a tool-specific pointer file (`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, etc.), **installs the bundled Expansions and builds the Cockpit dashboard so it's ready to launch**, and reports the team is online. It will ask once for your first name and one "proceed?" consent — everything runs and stays on your machine, nothing is uploaded. When it finishes, double-click the generated launcher in `Expansions/mypka-cockpit/` to open the Cockpit.
5. Ask "Who are you?" and you'll see Larry is at your service.
6. Ask "What's open?" and Larry walks the new `Team Knowledge/tasks/open/` folder for you.

That's the whole setup. There is no install step.

Once you have the team online and start using it, you'll hit moments where you wonder why a folder is shaped the way it is. That's where the courses come in. They teach the WHY behind every folder choice, so you understand why the team is built like real humans operating on the **ICOR methodology**, not just another AI scaffold. More on that below.

## What you get

A working knowledge system, fully assembled, that does this on day one:

- **Organizes your life from a single daily journal.** You write what happened. The team files the people, projects, decisions, and ideas where they belong. Connections between notes are made for you.
- **Remembers unfinished work for you.** When something can't finish in one turn, the team writes it down as a task in `Team Knowledge/tasks/`. Next session, Larry walks `tasks/open/` and surfaces what's waiting. The team genuinely picks up where it left off.
- **Carries learning forward.** Each specialist keeps a journal of durable insights at `Team/<Name>/journal/`. When a task references one of their entries, they re-read their own past thinking before starting work.
- **Runs in any LLM you already use.** Claude Code (and Claude Cowork), Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Cursor, ChatGPT, Obsidian with a chat plugin. The same scaffold, the same team, the same files. You change models. Your knowledge doesn't move. Session-log triggers (`close session`, `keep this in mind`, `let's realign`, etc.) work with any LLM that reads `AGENTS.md` — ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Cursor, Cline, Codex, and the rest. Not Claude-only.
- **Stays in plain markdown.** Every note is a `.md` file. You can read it without the AI. You can grep it. You can sync it with Dropbox or git. You can open it in Obsidian and keep working with no AI at all.
- **Upgrades to SQLite when you outgrow plain files.** Once your myPKA gets large, paste the prompt at `Team Knowledge/SOPs/SOP-002-convert-mypka-to-sqlite.md` into your LLM. Markdown stays canonical. SQLite becomes a fast lookup layer on top.
- **Imports from any PKM tool.** Drop your existing notes (Heptabase backup, Notion export, Obsidian vault, Roam graph, Logseq folder, Apple Notes export, Evernote dump, Tana via MCP, etc.) anywhere on disk, then ask your LLM something like *"import my Notion export from `~/Downloads/notion.zip`"* or *"how do I bring in my Heptabase backup?"*. The scaffold ships with [[Team Knowledge/Workstreams/WS-002-import-external-knowledge-base]] — the LLM follows it to extract entities (people, organizations, projects, goals, habits, topics, key elements, documents), normalize wikilinks to the slug form, copy attachments into `PKM/Images/YYYY/MM/`, and place files into the right folders, asking clarifying questions where needed and never overwriting your myPKA without explicit approval. Works with any LLM that reads `AGENTS.md`.

There is no lock-in. The whole system is text on your disk. It works in Obsidian today. It upgrades to SQLite when you want it. It runs on whichever model or LLM you prefer, and it keeps running when you switch.

## Who this is for

- **Knowledge workers** who want a local folder setup instead of handing over their knowledge to Notion, Tana etc. and want an AI team that actually files things. Transparent and accessible.
- **Founders and operators** running multiple projects who need a knowledge system that thinks across People, Topics, Goals, Habits, and Key Elements without manual cross-linking.
- **Parents and generalists** with too many inputs (school stuff, health stuff, ideas, contacts) and no structure to hold it.
- **AI tinkerers** who want a real reference architecture for a multi-agent setup, not a toy demo.

If you've ever opened a blank Obsidian vault and didn't know where to put anything, this is for you. (Yes — myPKA is fully Obsidian-compatible. Open the folder as an Obsidian vault and everything just works.)

## Meet the team

**Twelve specialists ship pre-loaded** in this all-in-one bundle. **You only ever talk to Larry.** Larry routes. The base six are profiled below; the six from the preinstalled App Developer and Designer packs (Felix, Vex, Vera, Iris, Charta, Pixel) are summarized right after the table, with full contracts at `Team/<Name> - <Role>/AGENTS.md`.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="140" align="center"><img src="github/team/larry.png" width="120" alt="Larry the Red Fox - Team Leader and Orchestrator" /></td>
<td><b>Larry - Team Leader & Orchestrator</b><br/><i>A Red Fox. Sharp ears, sharper instincts.</i><br/><br/>Every request you make lands with Larry first. He clarifies, picks the right specialist, hands off the brief, and synthesizes the answer back to you. He's also the team's <b>Librarian</b> (keeps the wiki clean, fixes broken <code>[[wikilinks]]</code>, enforces the SSOT Golden Rule), <b>Session-Log Author</b> (writes a daily log of what the team did and what changed), and the team's <b>Task Walker</b> (surfaces what's open at session start). Larry never executes specialist work himself - that's the iron rule.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="140" align="center"><img src="github/team/nolan.png" width="120" alt="Nolan the Pitbull - Talent Acquisition" /></td>
<td><b>Nolan - Talent Acquisition</b><br/><i>A Pitbull in glasses. Loyal, methodical, allergic to lazy hires.</i><br/><br/>When you outgrow the six shipped specialists, Nolan handles the hire end-to-end: briefs Pax for research, drafts the new specialist's contract (<code>AGENTS.md</code>), validates against the SOP, and gets your sign-off before adding anyone to the roster. Nolan is the reason your team scales without diluting.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="140" align="center"><img src="github/team/pax.png" width="120" alt="Pax the Raven - Deep Research" /></td>
<td><b>Pax - Deep Research</b><br/><i>A Raven. Patient, source-cited, allergic to a single-source answer.</i><br/><br/>When something matters - a hire, a market read, a "is this actually true" - Pax goes wide before going deep. Returns a triangulated brief in <code>Deliverables/</code>, never a one-shot opinion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="140" align="center"><img src="github/team/penn.png" width="120" alt="Penn the Owl - Journal Writer" /></td>
<td><b>Penn - Journal Writer</b><br/><i>A Barn Owl. Quiet, watchful, careful filer.</i><br/><br/>Penn handles the team's scribe duties. Drop screenshots, voice memos, business cards, or rough thoughts into <code>Team Inbox/</code>. Penn files everything into the right corner of <code>PKM/</code> with the right <code>[[wikilinks]]</code>. He never forgets where things go and never assumes you're done thinking when you drop something in.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="140" align="center"><img src="github/team/mack.png" width="120" alt="Mack - Automation and Integration Specialist" /></td>
<td><b>Mack - Automation & Integration Specialist</b><br/><i>The connection layer. Quiet when it works, loud when it breaks.</i><br/><br/>Mack wires your myPKA to the rest of the world. MCP server setup, API integrations, webhook receivers, OAuth flows, and any automation that needs to run reliably in the background. When an external knowledge import needs an authenticated fetch first (Notion API, Apple Notes export, a live MCP server), Mack establishes the connection, lands the bytes at a path, and hands off to Silas to run the actual import. Idempotency, retries, structured logs, credentials in <code>.env</code> — never in code.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="140" align="center"><img src="github/team/silas.png" width="120" alt="Silas - Database Architect" /></td>
<td><b>Silas - Database Architect</b><br/><i>Schema is destiny. Slugs are primary keys.</i><br/><br/>Silas guards the structural integrity of your knowledge base. He runs external knowledge imports (drop a Notion zip, a Heptabase backup, an Obsidian vault, a Roam graph — Silas runs <code>WS-002</code> and lands the entities in the right folders), audits frontmatter against <code>GL-002</code>, catches schema drift before it spreads, and runs the markdown-to-SQLite conversion (<code>SOP-002</code>) when your myPKA outgrows plain files. Markdown stays canonical; the SQLite mirror is a regenerable performance layer. Silas never invents fields, never silently rewrites content, and never lets ad-hoc YAML keys accumulate.</td>
</tr>
</table>

Each specialist has a contract at `Team/<Name> - <Role>/AGENTS.md` and a `journal/` folder for durable insights. Full routing table at `Team/agent-index.md`.

**Also preinstalled in this bundle — the App Developer Pack and the Designer Pack:**

- **Felix - Frontend Developer.** Builds UI components and frontends to spec; the hands behind the Cockpit's interface work.
- **Vex - Security Engineer.** Threat-models, audits, and reviews anything that touches keys, MCP configs, or external code — including the security gate on installed Expansions.
- **Vera - QA Specialist.** Designs and runs the quality gate; the green/red signal before anything ships.
- **Iris - Design System Architect.** Owns the design system (`GL-003-design-system`) — tokens, components, and the rules everyone else designs against.
- **Charta - Infographic Designer.** Turns content into clean, on-brand infographics and renders deliverables to HTML/PDF.
- **Pixel - Visual Specialist.** Generates styled images and avatars within the design system.

## What lives where

- `PKM/` is your knowledge. `My Life/` holds the five life concepts (Goals, Habits, Topics, Projects, Key Elements). `Documents/`, `CRM/`, `Images/`, and `Journal/` sit alongside it. Notes connect through `[[wikilinks]]`, not nested folders.
- `Team/` holds your specialists. One folder per agent. Each has its own `AGENTS.md` and its own `journal/` for durable cross-session insights.
- `Team Knowledge/` holds the team's playbook. SOPs are atomic procedures. Workstreams orchestrate multi-agent flows. Guidelines are static reference info. `tasks/` holds unfinished work the team is tracking across sessions (`open/`, `in-progress/`, `done/<YYYY>/<MM>/`, `cancelled/<YYYY>/<MM>/`).
- `Deliverables/` is where the team puts work-in-progress and finished artifacts - research briefs, hire workups, multi-file projects. Time-stamped, ephemeral, the team's working surface. **Pax** drops research here. **Nolan** drops hire workups here. **Larry** collects multi-specialist work here.
- `Team Inbox/` is your drop zone for raw inputs. Drop screenshots, voice memos, business cards, links, or a quick braindump and the team files them into PKM. *"I have something, not sure where"* goes here. **Penn** usually picks it up, **Larry** routes it.
- `AGENTS.md` at the root is the source of truth for how the whole team behaves.

> **Note on note shape.** Every entity note (a Person, an Organization, a Project, a Goal, a Habit, a Topic, a Key Element, a Document) starts from a template in `Team Knowledge/Templates/`. Structured data lives in YAML frontmatter at the top of the file; narrative lives in the body. The canonical field schemas are in [[Team Knowledge/Guidelines/GL-002-frontmatter-conventions]]. The mypka-interface Properties tab and the SQLite migration both read frontmatter — keep your facts there, your stories in the body.

## How a task flows

Here's the whole shape, in plain English.

You ask the team to do something that won't finish in one turn. Larry (or whoever picked up the request) writes a small markdown file into `Team Knowledge/tasks/open/`. The frontmatter names who it's for, why it matters, and what context already exists: which SOP applies, which workstream it belongs to, which session log birthed it, which life entry it touches, which journal entry the assignee should re-read first. The body restates the work in your words.

When the assignee picks it up, the file moves from `open/` to `in-progress/` and they leave a one-line update inside it. They keep working. If they get blocked, they write the reason in the frontmatter so they (or someone else) know what to chase. When it's done, the file moves to `done/<year>/<month>/` with the outcome written in.

Next session, Larry walks `tasks/open/` and `tasks/in-progress/` first, before doing anything else. The team starts the day knowing what's waiting and where things stood. Nothing falls on the floor between sessions.

The journal sits next to this. When the assignee learns something durable while working a task — a build pattern that worked, an anti-pattern they want to remember, a rule of thumb — they write a short entry in their `journal/`. The next time a task references that entry, they re-read their own past thinking before starting. Learning compounds across sessions.

## About this bundle vs. the à-la-carte packs

v3.0.0 is a **new bundle SKU**, not a forced migration. Two distribution shapes coexist:

- **This all-in-one bundle** (what you're looking at) ships the base scaffold, the myPKA Cockpit, the App Developer Pack, and the Designer Pack **all preinstalled** — 12 specialists, the Cockpit interface, and every pack SOP/Guideline in place on first clone. No install step. New users wanting the full capability should download this.
- **The à-la-carte packs** (Cockpit, App Developer, Designer) remain published separately from the AI Library. If you already run the lean base scaffold and want to add **one** capability at a time, install just the pack you need via the normal [[WS-003-install-an-expansion]] flow. Adopters of the base scaffold are **unaffected** by this release — there is nothing to migrate.

After downloading, run `bash validation-script.sh .` from the scaffold root — it exits 0 when the structure is intact. See the `[3.0.0]` entry in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full bundle manifest.

## Principles

A few things we believe, that the folder is shaped around.

- **Continuity over ceremony.** The team should be able to pick up where it left off, across sessions, even when a different specialist takes over. Tasks and journals serve that, nothing else. There is no lifecycle theater.
- **The folder is the database.** Plain markdown, on your disk, readable without the AI. Frontmatter is the machine-readable layer. Wikilinks are the navigation layer. All three reinforce each other so any one of them is enough to act.
- **Portability is the point.** You can swap LLM tools without migrating. You can sync the folder with Dropbox, iCloud, or git. You can open it in Obsidian on your phone. Your knowledge follows you, not the vendor.
- **LLM-agnostic by construction.** Anything the team does, any agent can do, with `mv`, `mkdir`, `grep`, `awk`. No model-specific magic. No proprietary tool calls. If you can read markdown, you can run myPKA.
- **Additive upgrades only.** When the scaffold gains a capability, older folders gain it without losing anything. Migration is plain-text recipes you can audit. Nothing destructive without your explicit OK.

## Coming from another tool?

- **Obsidian users**: open your myPKA folder as an Obsidian vault. Wikilinks, tags, and Markdown work as you expect. The scaffold adds an AI team on top of the folder you already understand.
- **Notion users**: the closest analogue is "Pages with AI inside, but the pages are files on your disk." You lose Notion's database views. You gain ownership of every byte and the ability to swap LLMs without migrating.
- **Roam / Logseq users**: same daily-note instinct. The team handles the cross-linking you used to do by hand.

## The deeper story: ICOR methodology

If you want to really manage your life efficiently and run this folder structure the way it is meant to work, the methodology is the missing layer.

myPKA is built on the **My Life** part of the **ICOR methodology**. ICOR is tool-agnostic Paperless Movement S.L. and thousands of professionals use to run both personal life and business: five life concepts on one side, five business concepts on the other, with a shared way of capturing, processing, and acting on information. We have been running on it for years. The scaffold you just downloaded is one slice of that framework, made operational.

Watch the deep-dive walkthrough where Dr. Thomas Rödl builds the system from scratch and explains the reasoning behind each folder, each agent, and each routing rule:

**[Watch the deep-dive on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FwPlAQeJcXI)**

The full courses live at **[myicor.com](https://myicor.com)**. They cover:

- **The Personal half (myPKA)**: the WHY behind every folder in this scaffold, how the five life concepts (Goals, Habits, Topics, Projects, Key Elements) connect, and how to operate the team so it actually saves you time instead of becoming another tool to manage.
- **The Business half**: the same framework extended to companies, including the operating system Paperless Movement S.L. runs on internally.

The scaffold works on its own. The course is for people who want to understand why it works, so they can extend it without breaking the model.

## AI Library (membership)

This bundle already ships the Cockpit, the App Developer Pack, and the Designer Pack preinstalled — but the **AI Library** at [myicor.com](https://myicor.com) is the membership layer where you download **more** Expansions: drop-in folders that grow your team beyond the twelve specialists here. These Expansions are not in this repo and are not planned to be open-sourced:

- **Slack Expansion** so the team can read and act on conversations from your workspace.
- **Obsidian optimizations** including templates, plugins, and views tuned to the scaffold.
- **More agent packs** that drop into your `Expansions/` folder: a Marketing pack, a Customer Support pack, a Bookkeeping pack, and others. *(The App Developer and Designer packs are already preinstalled in this bundle.)*
- **Connector Expansions** for the tools you already live in (Notion, Readwise, Linear, …).
- **Office hours and walkthroughs** with the team that builds this scaffold.

Membership-only is honest, not a gate. The scaffold here is genuinely complete. The AI Library is for people running serious work on top of it. See `Expansions/docs/expansion-spec.md` for the install model.
