check-version.py - the myPKA boot-time update check.

PRIVACY NOTE (read this first)
==============================
This is the ONLY part of the myPKA update core that reaches the network, and it
is deliberately tiny. On boot it makes one read-only HTTPS request to the
official myPKA repository to fetch a single plain-text version string (for
example "4.0.0"). That is all it sends and all it receives. It SENDS NO DATA
ABOUT YOU: no vault contents, no file names, no identifiers, no telemetry. It is
a GET of a public version file. If you are offline, or anything goes wrong, it
stays silent and your boot continues normally (fail-silent). It compares that
remote string to your local scaffold_version (from manifest.json) and, only if a
newer version exists, prints one friendly line telling you an update is
available. It never downloads, applies, or changes anything. To turn it off,
set "update_check": {"enabled": false} in manifest.json.

This script is stdlib-only (urllib) so it runs without pip, npm, or an LLM.
