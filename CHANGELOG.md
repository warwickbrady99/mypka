# Changelog

All notable changes to the myPKA scaffold are tracked here. Versions follow semver: MAJOR for breaking structural changes, MINOR for additions, PATCH for fixes.

## [4.1.1] - 2026-06-23

**Cockpit day-planner drag-and-drop fix (critical).** A patch release that ships a
fixed bundled myPKA Cockpit. Two day-planner drag-and-drop defects are resolved: you
can now drop a task before or after a calendar event in a day-half lane, and dragging
an already-placed task up or down within the same column now lands and persists. This
is a Cockpit fix only: there are no structural changes to the scaffold and no changes
to your PKM, journals, tasks, or any of your own content.

### Fixed

- **Bundled Cockpit day-planner drag-and-drop fixed** (`Expansions/mypka-cockpit/`,
  cockpit version `1.2.0` -> `1.2.1`). Unified events+tasks position space (drop a
  task before/after an event) and direction-aware same-column reorder. Ships a new
  migration `008-unified-position-space.sql` that applies automatically on the next
  Cockpit boot via the planner's idempotent, append-only migration runner. No
  behavior changes outside the planner; no new dependencies.
- **Version mirrors bumped to `4.1.1`** (`manifest.json` is authoritative; `VERSION`
  and `.scaffold-version` mirror it). The bundled Cockpit's `expansion_yaml_version`
  in `manifest.json` is updated to `1.2.1` to match.

### Notes

- The Cockpit is a runtime Expansion and is updated on its own version, separate from
  the scaffold version. The scaffold self-updater never overwrites Cockpit code; it
  defers to the Cockpit's own update path. This release simply ships the newer Cockpit
  inside the scaffold download.

## [4.1.0] - 2026-06-23

**The Graphite Cockpit.** The bundled myPKA Cockpit gets a full visual redesign. Its default dark theme moves from a warm charcoal to a cool, near-black **Graphite** canvas, with a cool near-white text ramp and **brass retained as the single signature accent**. The result is a calmer, more precise instrument that keeps the one colour that points (brass) while adopting a quieter, more neutral field around it.

This is a visual-only release: there are no structural changes to the scaffold, no changes to your PKM, journals, tasks, or any of your own content, and nothing new to learn. If you run the Cockpit, the next time you build it you will see the new look.

### Changed

- **Bundled Cockpit redesigned to the "Graphite" dark theme** (`Expansions/mypka-cockpit/`, cockpit version `1.1.0` -> `1.2.0`). A pure CSS reskin: a design-token retune (`web/src/index.css`) plus chrome refinements (`web/src/cockpit.css`). No behavior, data, API, or schema changes; no new dependencies. The Cockpit web bundle is built at install time, so the new theme appears on your next Cockpit build.
- **Version mirrors bumped to `4.1.0`** (`manifest.json` is authoritative; `VERSION` and `.scaffold-version` mirror it). The bundled Cockpit's `expansion_yaml_version` in `manifest.json` is updated to `1.2.0` to match.

### Notes

- The Cockpit is a runtime Expansion and is updated on its own version, separate from the scaffold version. The scaffold self-updater never overwrites Cockpit code; it defers to the Cockpit's own update path. This release simply ships the newer Cockpit inside the scaffold download.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-06-22

**The self-updating, model-agnostic, self-improving release.** myPKA stops being a folder you manually re-sync and becomes a product that can update itself. The line between the framework (ours, upgradable) and your own state (yours, sacred) is now written down as machine-readable data, so an update can confidently overwrite our files while never touching yours. One command (or one sentence to your assistant) shows you exactly what will change before anything happens, and the scaffold tells you on boot when a new version exists.

> **BREAKING.** This is the first myPKA release that is not purely additive. It introduces a real framework/user-state seam. Members on 3.1.0 take a one-time bridged update that lays down `manifest.json` and the `.mypka/` control folder. The bridge is numbered, idempotent, and auditable: see the `3.1.0 -> 4.0.0` recipe in `CHANGELOG-MIGRATION.md`. Your own content (PKM, journals, tasks, session logs, Expansions, secrets, databases) is never moved or modified by the bridge.

### Added

- **A machine-readable `manifest.json` at the scaffold root: the new version SSOT and the framework/user-state seam as data.** It declares `scaffold_version` (now authoritative), `framework_paths` (the allow-list of files the updater MAY overwrite), and `user_state_paths` (the sacred list the updater will NEVER write). Every fact about "what is ours vs. what is yours" now lives in one inspectable file instead of in tribal knowledge.
- **A one-command updater: `/update-scaffold` (and the portable trigger "update myPKA"), backed by a plain script `scripts/update-scaffold.py`.** The script is python3 stdlib only (no pip, no npm) so it runs without an LLM. It diffs only `framework_paths`, prints a plain-English plan ("3 new SOPs, 1 changed guideline, 0 of your files touched"), is **dry-run by default**, applies only on `--apply`, **backs up any locally modified framework file to `.mypka/backups/<timestamp>/` before overwriting** (never a silent overwrite of your edit), refuses to write outside `framework_paths`, and is fully offline-safe and fail-closed.
- **A boot-time update notification: `scripts/check-version.py`.** Announced-on by default (Tom's decision). It is the only network reach in the update core: it fetches a single version string over HTTPS, read-only, **sends no data about you or your vault**, fails silently offline, and prints one line only when a newer version exists. It never downloads or applies anything. Disclosed in the script header and in `manifest.json` under `update_check`; turn it off with `update_check.enabled: false`.
- **A separable cockpit-code update path.** The Cockpit (and every Expansion) is versioned on its own `expansion.yaml` SemVer, not on the scaffold version. The scaffold updater detects a behind cockpit and **defers** to the cockpit's own updater instead of touching Expansion code. The cockpit updater lifecycle is specified in `Expansions/mypka-cockpit/scripts/UPDATE-COCKPIT.md` (marked clearly as a SPEC: the working updater plus versioned DB migrations are still to be built and security-reviewed before they ship).
- **The new `model:` frontmatter field** (Silas is adding it to `GL-002` in parallel). This records which model an agent contract was authored/validated against, supporting the LLM-agnostic posture below. Reference `GL-002` for the field's authoritative definition.
- **The LLM-agnostic portable-core / adapter rule, plus an agnosticism audit** (Nolan and Silas are adding the Guideline and the audit Workstream in parallel). The portable core is the model-neutral contract; the adapter layer (for example `ADAPTER-PROMPT.md` and the `.claude/` shims) is where a specific host binds. Reference the new Guideline and the audit once landed.
- **The Team Retro self-improvement Workstream** (Nolan is adding it in parallel): a recurring, structured retro that lets the team improve its own operating knowledge over time. Reference the new `WS` once landed.
- **The `.mypka/` control folder.** A small hidden folder the updater creates on first run, holding `backups/`, an `update-log.txt`, and a copy of the active manifest. It is user-state: never overwritten by an update.

### Changed

- **`VERSION` and `.scaffold-version` are now mirrors, not the source of truth.** They still exist for back-compat with older tooling and both now read `4.0.0`, but `manifest.json` is authoritative. If they ever disagree, `manifest.json` wins (documented in the manifest's `version_files` block).

### Why this is a major version

Until now an update meant "re-download the folder and hope you remembered which files you changed." That works while the folder is purely additive. It breaks the moment we need to ship a changed framework file safely. v4.0.0 draws the framework/user-state boundary explicitly and in data, so the updater can act on it without guessing. That boundary is the breaking change, and it is the foundation every later self-update builds on. The Hermes-Agent lesson applies: separate the engine directory from the state directory, and never write user data into the engine.

### Version files

- `manifest.json` → new; `scaffold_version` `4.0.0`, authoritative SSOT.
- `VERSION` → `4.0.0` (was `3.1.0`; now a mirror of the manifest).
- `.scaffold-version` → `4.0.0` (was `3.1.0`; now a mirror of the manifest).

## [3.1.0] - 2026-06-22

**The Cockpit gets a "My AI Team" section: browse your team, session log, and governance docs (Workstreams / SOPs / Guidelines) right inside the local viewer.** This is a Cockpit-feature release — the base scaffold structure is unchanged. It also folds in the v3.0.1 slug fix. New features ship as **source**; the Cockpit rebuilds its UI bundle (`web/dist`) on first run, so an existing install picks the features up by pulling the new files, regenerating the mirror, and rebuilding/restarting (steps below).

### Added

- **Cockpit "My AI Team" fly-out menu.** A new sidebar fly-out exposes five team destinations: **Team** (the roster), **Session Log**, **Workstreams**, **SOPs**, and **Guidelines**. Your specialists and your operating knowledge are now first-class navigation in the Cockpit, not invisible to the viewer.
- **Workstreams, SOPs, and Guidelines are now indexed in the `mypka.db` mirror.** `Expansions/mypka-cockpit/scripts/regen-mypka-db.py` gains new tables for the three governance-doc families (`workstreams`, `sops`, `guidelines`), so they are queryable in the mirror and browsable in the Cockpit. **You must re-run the regen for these to populate** (command below).
- **New read-only Cockpit endpoint `GET /api/cockpit/team-knowledge/:family`** (`:family` ∈ `workstreams` | `sops` | `guidelines`), served by the new `Expansions/mypka-cockpit/server/teamKnowledgeApi.js`. Read-only; serves the indexed governance docs to the new list views.

### Changed

- **Session Log and Roster are now separate, full-height pages.** They were previously crammed into a single cramped view; each is now its own route. Team pages use the full viewport height, fixing the content crop.

### Fixed

- **Includes the v3.0.1 fix:** Cockpit Fleeting-Note and Journal capture no longer fails with `title produced an empty slug` for titles made entirely of non-Latin script (Korean / Chinese / Japanese / Cyrillic / Greek / Arabic / Hebrew / Thai), emoji, or punctuation. The capture now falls back to a safe generated slug (`fleeting-<timestamp>` / `<date>-entry`) and preserves the original title in the note. All security guards intact. (Full detail under `[3.0.1]` below.)

### Files of note (so an existing install's LLM can pull just this)

This is a **Cockpit-only** change set — no base-scaffold files change. The new/changed Cockpit files are:

- **New UI views** — `Expansions/mypka-cockpit/web/src/views/SessionLogView.tsx`, `web/src/views/TeamKnowledgeListView.tsx`, `web/src/views/team/SessionLogFeed.tsx`, plus updated `web/src/views/RosterView.tsx` and `web/src/views/FileView.tsx`.
- **Sidebar fly-out + routing + strings** — `web/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`, `web/src/lib/router.ts`, `web/src/App.tsx`, `web/src/lib/strings.ts`, `web/src/cockpit.css`, `web/src/views/team.css`.
- **New server endpoint** — `Expansions/mypka-cockpit/server/teamKnowledgeApi.js` (and its wiring in `server/server.js`).
- **Mirror regen with the new tables** — `Expansions/mypka-cockpit/scripts/regen-mypka-db.py` (plus the contract docs `docs/db-contract.md` and `sqlite-extension/DATA-CONTRACT.md`).

**To pull this into an existing install (no full re-download needed):**

1. Replace/add the Cockpit files listed above with their v3.1.0 versions.
2. **Re-run the mirror regen** to create + populate the new governance tables:
   `python3 "Expansions/mypka-cockpit/scripts/regen-mypka-db.py"`
3. **Rebuild and restart the Cockpit** so the new UI and the new server route load:
   `cd Expansions/mypka-cockpit && npm run serve` (this runs `npm run build` → rebuilds `web/dist` → starts the server).

Note: `web/dist` and `mypka.db` are intentionally **not** shipped in the release archive (both are gitignored, regenerable). The release ships UI **source**; the Cockpit builds `web/dist` on first run and regenerates `mypka.db` from your real scaffold. This is why steps 2–3 are required after pulling.

### Version files

- `VERSION` → `3.1.0` (was `3.0.1`)
- `.scaffold-version` → `3.1.0` (was `3.0.1`)
- `Expansions/mypka-cockpit/expansion.yaml` → `1.1.0` (was `1.0.1`)
- Cockpit `package.json` / `web/package.json` / `package-lock.json` → `1.1.0` (mirror `expansion.yaml`; reconciled — they had drifted at `1.0.0`)
- Cockpit `CHANGELOG.md` adds `[1.1.0]` and renumbers the prior slug-fix entry from the mislabeled `[3.0.1]` to `[1.0.1]` (the Cockpit CHANGELOG tracks `expansion.yaml`, not the scaffold version)

## [3.0.1] - 2026-06-22

**Hotfix: the Cockpit can now create Fleeting Notes and Journal entries for non-Latin / emoji / punctuation-only titles.** Cockpit-only fix — no scaffold-wide structural change. Two server files change; nothing else in the scaffold is touched.

### Fixed

- **The bug.** In the myPKA Cockpit, creating a **Fleeting Note** or a **Journal entry** failed with the error **`title produced an empty slug`** (HTTP 400) whenever the title was made entirely of **non-Latin script** (Korean / Chinese / Japanese / Cyrillic / Greek / Arabic / Hebrew / Thai / etc.), **emoji**, or **punctuation only**. The Cockpit derives the note's filename from the title by slugifying it, and the slugifier is ASCII-only — so a title like `한글 메모`, `中文笔记`, `🎉🎉`, or `!!!` slugified to an empty string and the capture was rejected purely on the title's character set.
- **The fix.** When a title slugifies to empty, the Cockpit now **falls back to a safe generated slug** instead of refusing the capture: `fleeting-<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS>` for a Fleeting Note and `<date>-entry` for a Journal entry. The **original title is preserved in the note** — a Fleeting Note prepends it as an H1 (so it is recovered as the note's title), and a Journal entry records it verbatim in the `title:` frontmatter field. ASCII titles are unchanged (`Test Note` → `test-note`, `café` → `cafe`). All security guards are intact: a path-like title (`..`, `/`, `\`, NUL) is still refused, reserved names are still reserved, and there is still no silent overwrite.

### Files changed (exactly two)

- `Expansions/mypka-cockpit/server/workbench.js` — Fleeting Notes create path (`fleeting-<timestamp>` fallback + H1 title preservation).
- `Expansions/mypka-cockpit/server/journalEntries.js` — Journal create path (`<date>-entry` fallback; title preserved in `title:` frontmatter).

A regression test (`Expansions/mypka-cockpit/server/workbench.slug.test.mjs`) and the Cockpit's own `Expansions/mypka-cockpit/CHANGELOG.md` accompany the fix.

### How to pull this into an existing install

This is a **Cockpit-only** fix. If you already run the Cockpit and only want this fix, you do **not** need to re-download the whole scaffold:

1. Replace these two files with the v3.0.1 versions (or apply the slug-fallback change to each):
   - `Expansions/mypka-cockpit/server/workbench.js`
   - `Expansions/mypka-cockpit/server/journalEntries.js`
2. **Restart the Cockpit** (stop the local server and start it again) so the new server code loads.

No `mypka.db` regeneration, no team change, and no other scaffold edits are required. Existing notes are unaffected.

### Version files

- `VERSION` → `3.0.1` (was `3.0.0`)
- `.scaffold-version` → `3.0.1` (was `3.0.0`)
- `Expansions/mypka-cockpit/expansion.yaml` → `1.0.1` (was `1.0.0`)

## [3.0.0] - 2026-06-21

**The all-in-one bundle: base scaffold 2.4.0 + myPKA Cockpit + App Developer Pack + Designer Pack, all preinstalled.** This is the max-capability download for new users — a single folder that ships the full base scaffold plus the local Cockpit viewer and a 12-specialist team out of the box, with no install step required. The à-la-carte packs (Cockpit, App Developer, Designer) remain published separately as the upgrade path for existing scaffolds; both distribution shapes coexist. The major bump reflects that the default download's team roster, SOP/Guideline set, and `Expansions/` contents all change shape — adopters of the base 2.4.0 are unaffected (this is a new bundle SKU, not a forced migration).

### Added

- **myPKA Cockpit v1.0.0 preinstalled** at `Expansions/mypka-cockpit/` — a local, navigable, wikilink-aware viewer over the whole scaffold (reads `mypka.db` read-only). Runtime-type Expansion; self-contained under its folder; declares no team merge. BYO-Claude-key, local-only, **no auto-launch** (the user generates an OS launcher per `launcher/GENERATE-LAUNCHER.md` and starts it themselves). Ships its own `LICENSE` (myICOR Cockpit Personal-Use License, PolyForm-Noncommercial-based), `SECURITY.md`, `DISCLAIMER.md`, and `INSTALL.md`.
- **App Developer Pack v1.0.1 preinstalled** — adds **Felix** (Frontend Developer), **Vex** (Security Engineer), **Vera** (QA Specialist) to `Team/`, plus `SOP-003-felix-build-a-component`, `SOP-004-vex-security-audit`, `SOP-005-vera-quality-gate`.
- **Designer Expansion Pack v1.1.0 preinstalled** — adds **Iris** (Design System Architect), **Charta** (Infographic Designer), **Pixel** (Visual Specialist) to `Team/`, plus `SOP-006-author-a-design-system`, `SOP-007-audit-content-for-design-system-compliance`, `SOP-008-build-an-infographic`, `SOP-009-generate-a-styled-image`, and **`GL-003-design-system`** (the previously-reserved design-system SSOT slot, now filled).
- **Team roster: 6 → 12 specialists.** Root `AGENTS.md` team table and `Team/agent-index.md` updated with all six new specialists and their routing triggers.
- **Claude Code host shims** at `.claude/agents/` for the six new specialists (`felix`, `vex`, `vera`, `iris`, `charta`, `pixel`), matching the base scaffold's host-binding convention so the bundle dispatches out-of-the-box.
- **`Expansions/INDEX.md`** now records all three bundled Expansions as preinstalled (3 expansions · 0 invalid · 0 incompatible).

### Licensing

- **Relicensed to NonCommercial.** The base scaffold now ships under **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** (was a prior permissive posture); free for personal and non-commercial use, with attribution and ShareAlike. The Cockpit runtime ships under the **myICOR Cockpit Personal-Use License** (PolyForm-Noncommercial-1.0.0-based); the App Developer and Designer packs under **CC BY-NC 4.0 (adapted)**.
- **`LICENSE-MAP.md` added** — a single plain-language map reconciling every subtree's license (base scaffold, Cockpit, both packs) into one coherent, bundle-wide statement, with per-subtree MAY / MAY-NOT boundaries. `README.md`, `NOTICE.md`, and the per-Expansion `LICENSE`/`NOTICE` files reconcile to it.

### Launch-day hardening

- README rewritten for the v3.0.0 all-in-one (12-specialist roster, preinstalled Cockpit interface, both packs preinstalled; version badge 2.1.0 → 3.0.0).
- ADAPTER-PROMPT and root AGENTS.md reconciled to the bundled-12 roster and the preinstalled-Cockpit setup flow.
- `.github/` release + snapshot-notify workflow adjustments for the v3.0.0 cut.

### Changed

- **SOP numbering.** SOP-003 through SOP-009 are now claimed by the bundled packs (App Developer → 003–005, Designer → 006–009). Reserved range starts at SOP-010. Descriptive `[[SOP-...]]` wikilinks inside the merged SOPs and the six new agent contracts were rewritten to their auto-numbered slugs per WS-003 §3.2; the à-la-carte pack copies under `Expansions/app-developer/` and `Expansions/designer-pack/` keep descriptive links (they renumber at install time on whatever scaffold they land in).
- **Guidelines.** GL-003 is no longer reserved — it is filled by the Designer Pack. Next free slot is GL-005.

### Distribution / gates

- **Lex — license posture: RECONCILED.** The base scaffold (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0), the Cockpit's PolyForm-Noncommercial personal-use license, and the two packs' CC BY-NC 4.0 are reconciled into one coherent bundle-license statement in `LICENSE-MAP.md`. Re-verify the BYO-Claude-key allowance against the live Anthropic Usage Policy + Commercial Terms at the moment of public push (Lex owns the legal call).
- **Vex — bundled-pack security gate: confirm before public push.** Token sweep + trust-tier check over the three preinstalled Expansions (WS-003 §2) across the bundle. To be confirmed green at push time.
- **BYO-Claude-key compliance:** the Cockpit reads the user's own key locally; no pooling, proxying, central storage, or key in any artifact — re-verified at push time. Release-blocking if violated.

### Migration

New users download this bundle and get everything preinstalled — no action. Existing-scaffold users do **not** need this bundle; they adopt individual capabilities via the à-la-carte packs (Cockpit / App Developer / Designer) through the normal [[WS-003-install-an-expansion]] flow. There is no forced migration from 2.4.0.

### Version files

- `VERSION` → `3.0.0` (was `2.4.0`)
- `.scaffold-version` → `3.0.0` (was `2.4.0`)

## [2.4.0] - 2026-06-18

**Ships local version history out of the box.** First-time initialization now offers to switch on local git versioning — a plain-language "time machine" for the folder — so new downloads get a roll-back safety net from day one. The offer is opt-in but strongly recommended: the adapter asks the user once, explains in non-technical terms that the history stays entirely on their computer (nothing uploaded or shared unless they later deliberately choose to) and that it lets them undo changes and roll back if an edit ever breaks something, and on yes runs a local-only `git init` + initial commit. The shipped `.gitignore` is hardened so that "nothing is shared / safe rollback" is actually true — it now excludes secrets, the derived database mirror, dependencies, build artifacts, and logs while still tracking the keys-only `.env.example`. The `VERSION` / `.scaffold-version` mismatch left by the 2.3.0 release is reconciled.

### Added

- **ADAPTER-PROMPT new step 5 "Offer local version history."** Inserted immediately after personalization (step 4) and before the tool-pointer-file step, so the first commit captures a clean, personalized baseline and everything after it is versioned. The adapter asks the user exactly once, in plain language, framing git as a local time machine / version history; covers (a) it stays entirely on the user's machine, nothing uploaded or shared unless they later deliberately choose to, (b) it lets them undo changes and roll back to any earlier state if an edit breaks something, (c) it is strongly recommended from the very start. Opt-in but recommended-yes; declining is fine and re-offer on a later activation is allowed. On yes: verify git is available, confirm the protective `.gitignore` is in place **before** committing, then `git init` → `git add -A` → `git commit -m "chore: initialize myPKA version history"`, with **no remote and no push** (local only). Idempotent: if a `.git` folder already exists, skip init and note it. Host-agnostic (plain shell `git`); hosts that cannot run shell commands hand the user the exact commands to paste. Includes a safety note that any later off-machine backup/sync must be a deliberate, reviewed choice using a **private** repo because the folder holds personal data.
- **`VERSION HISTORY:` report-back field** in ADAPTER-PROMPT — the adapter now reports the outcome of the version-history offer as `initialized` | `declined` | `already a git repo`.

### Changed

- **`.gitignore` hardened.** Previously OS/editor cruft only (`.DS_Store`, `__MACOSX/`, `*.swp`, Obsidian workspace/cache). Now also excludes: `.env` / `.env.*` at any depth (e.g. installed-Expansion secrets at `Expansions/<slug>/.env`) with a negation that keeps the keys-only `.env.example` template tracked; local MCP server configs that may embed credentials (`.mcp.json`, `**/.mcp.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`); private keys/certs (`*.key`, `*.pem`, `id_rsa`); the derived SQLite mirror and sidecars (`*.db`, `*.db-wal`, `*.db-shm`, `*.sqlite`, `*.sqlite3`); dependencies and build artifacts (`node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `.next/`, `.cache/`, `*.tsbuildinfo`); and logs/runtime state (`*.log`, `logs/`, `tmp/`, `*.pid`). This is the safety dependency for the version-history offer: the user-facing "nothing is shared / safe rollback" claim is only true if the very first commit cannot capture secrets or runtime state.
- **ADAPTER-PROMPT step renumbering.** Former steps 5–9 become 6–10; the slash-command sub-step heading `### 7-bis` becomes `### 8-bis`; the "skip to step 5" personalization cross-reference and the step-10 roster-confirmation line are updated accordingly.

### Migration

Existing vaults need no action. Local version history is opt-in and can be turned on at any time — re-run the adapter prompt (it will offer it), or run it yourself from the folder root with the shipped `.gitignore` already in place: `git init` → `git add -A` → `git commit -m "chore: initialize myPKA version history"` (local only — do not add a remote or push). Vaults that are already git repos are detected and left untouched. If you upgrade an existing clone, refresh your local `.gitignore` from this release so the hardened exclusions apply before your next commit.

### Version files

- `VERSION` → `2.4.0` (was `2.3.0`)
- `.scaffold-version` → `2.4.0` (reconciliation: the 2.3.0 release bumped `VERSION` to `2.3.0` but left `.scaffold-version` at `2.2.0`; both are now realigned at `2.4.0`)

## [2.3.0] - 2026-06-03

**Aligns the "My Life" doctrine with the canonical ICOR / "PKM like a Pro" model.** The scaffold previously framed My Life as five peer buckets (Topics, Habits, Goals, Projects, Key Elements). It is now corrected to **four buckets — Key Elements, Projects, Habits, Topics — plus Goals as the operating layer**, with the relational laws the framework actually runs on made explicit and the schema updated to encode them. Adds the canonical teaching examples (a "lose 20 kg → Health" Goal carried by a Project or Habit; a "French" Topic that graduates into a Key Element) so any LLM reading the scaffold grasps the rules. Additive to the schema; one rule (Goal anchor) becomes required — see Migration.

### Changed

- **`PKM/My Life/README.md`, `INDEX.md`, and all six bucket `INDEX.md`s** — rewritten from "five buckets/shapes" to "four buckets + the Goals operating layer." State the **anchoring law** (every Goal anchors to exactly one Key Element — never a Project, never a Topic), the **carrier rule** (a Goal is achieved through exactly one of two sibling shapes — a Project OR a Habit; no third), **Topic → Key Element promotion** (and the reverse: a Key Element that leaves your life is archived), and the **filter test** (content fitting none of the four buckets doesn't belong in the PKM). Projects and Habits are reframed as *thinking spaces, not trackers*.
- **`Team Knowledge/Guidelines/GL-002-frontmatter-conventions.md`** — encodes the doctrine: Goal `key_element` is now **required and Key-Element-only**; the Project-or-Habit carrier rule is documented; new optional fields land for the promotion pipeline.
- **`Team Knowledge/Workstreams/WS-001-daily-journaling.md`** — Step-4 routing now enforces the anchor + single-carrier rules, runs the filter test before stubbing a My Life note, and proposes Topic → Key Element promotion when a Topic becomes a measurable pursuit.
- **`AGENTS.md`** (root) and **`Team/Penn - Journal Writer/AGENTS.md`** — taxonomy + routing map corrected to four-buckets-plus-Goals-layer, pointing to GL-002 for the relational doctrine.

### Added

- **`promoted_to` + `lifecycle`** (exploring | promoted | dormant) optional fields on **Topic** — encode the Topic → Key Element promotion pipeline.
- **`promoted_from` + an `archived` status** on **Key Element** — the reverse pointer and the "left my life" state.
- **`linked_goals`** on **Habit**, and a documented **`linked_topics`** on **Project** — the carrier and context relations.
- Canonical illustrative examples woven into GL-002, the templates, and the My Life docs (the "lose 20 kg → Health" Goal and the "French" Topic-to-Key-Element promotion).

### Migration

- Existing vaults: every **Goal** note now requires a `key_element` field pointing to a Key Element (never a Project or Topic). Add the anchor to any Goal that lacks one. All other changes are additive optional fields — no action required.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-26

**Adds the one-way Task → Resource linking rule and its `linked_deliverables` slot.** A task now carries seven `linked_*` arrays in its frontmatter — the new `linked_deliverables` joins `linked_sops`, `linked_workstreams`, `linked_guidelines`, `linked_my_life`, `linked_session_logs`, `linked_journal_entries` — and the task is the one place that records which deliverable folder a workflow owns. When a task closes (done or cancelled), every deliverable in its `linked_deliverables` cascades into `Deliverables/_archive/<YYYY>/<MM>/`. Resources (deliverables, journal entries, session logs, SOPs, Workstreams, Guidelines, My Life entries) never carry a back-pointer to a task — the link is one-way. Additive, non-breaking; existing tasks need a one-line frontmatter addition (see Migration).

### Added

- **`GL-004-task-resource-linking.md`** in `Team Knowledge/Guidelines/`. The canonical rule: task → resource, never the reverse. Defines what counts as a resource, the seven-array frontmatter contract, the `linked_deliverables` slug format (`<folder-slug>/<file-slug>` or `<folder-slug>`), the archive-on-close cascade, the sharing escape hatch for deliverables referenced by multiple tasks, and the orphan-deliverable rule.
- **`linked_deliverables: []`** field in `Team Knowledge/tasks/_template.md`. The seventh `linked_*` array. The template's `## Context one click away` body section gains a `Working artifacts:` sub-bullet group that mirrors the array.
- **`Deliverables/_archive/.gitkeep`** — seeds the archive folder so it ships in the scaffold on first clone.
- **Lifecycle section in `Deliverables/README.md`** — documents the archive-on-close cascade, the orphan-deliverable rule, and the shared-deliverable behavior. Wikilinks to GL-004 and SOP-close-task.

### Changed

- **`Team Knowledge/SOPs/SOP-create-task.md`** bumped to v1.1. Step 4's cross-reference walk table gains a `linked_deliverables` row. "Six linked_* arrays" copy bumps to "seven" throughout (inputs table, step 4 paragraph, step 5 bullet, common-mistakes section). A second worked example shows a task with `linked_deliverables` populated (the minimal mux-webhook example stays as-is for the empty-arrays case). References list adds `[[GL-004-task-resource-linking]]`.
- **`Team Knowledge/SOPs/SOP-close-task.md`** bumped to v1.1. New §A.3 pre-flight step: check deliverable sharing across other open/in-progress tasks before archiving. New §A.8 / §B.5 archive steps: move each `linked_deliverables` folder to `Deliverables/_archive/<YYYY>/<MM>/`. The "move the folder, not the file" rule is documented. The `## Outcome` shape gains an `Archived deliverables:` line. A second worked example walks the archive-on-close path; the original mux-webhook example stays as the no-deliverables case. References list adds `[[GL-004-task-resource-linking]]` and `[[SOP-002-convert-mypka-to-sqlite]]`.
- **`Team Knowledge/SOPs/SOP-claim-task.md`** — small update. Pre-flight read list adds `linked_deliverables` ("the working artifacts already in flight — skipping them means re-doing what's already done"). References list adds `[[GL-004-task-resource-linking]]`. Common-mistakes section notes that skipping `linked_deliverables` in pre-flight is a resumption hazard.
- **`Team Knowledge/tasks/open/EXAMPLE-tsk-2026-05-10-001-welcome-to-tasks.md`** — seeded teaching task updated to the seven-array shape (`linked_deliverables: []` added; `GL-004` added to `linked_guidelines`; "six arrays" copy in the body bumped to "seven"; an additional `Linking rule: [[GL-004-task-resource-linking]]` bullet appears in `## Context one click away`).
- **`Team Knowledge/Guidelines/INDEX.md`** — gains a row for GL-004 between GL-002 and the reserved-GL-003 note. The reserved note for GL-003 (Designer Expansion Pack) is unchanged.

### Migration

**Existing scaffold users with active tasks need a one-line frontmatter addition per task** to bring them up to the seven-array shape. A one-shot grep + sed pattern is suggested in the migration prompt exposed as the "upgrade" button in the myPKA course at https://myicor.com.

Tasks already in `done/` or `cancelled/` are historical record and do not need migration. The walk in [[SOP-create-task]] step 4 starts using all seven slots immediately from v2.2.0 onward.

Resources written before v2.2.0 may carry a pre-GL-004 `linked_tasks` field. Per the new one-way rule, that field is retired — remove it on touch. New writes never add it.

### Version files

- `VERSION` → `2.2.0`
- `.scaffold-version` → `2.2.0`

## [2.1.2] - 2026-05-20

**Repository moved to myICOR org for corporate ownership; remains public and free.** The canonical home of the myPKA scaffold is now `https://github.com/myICOR/myPKA` (transferred from `TomSolid/myPKA`). The repo stays public under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 and continues to be the free distribution channel; the myicor.com SaaS layer remains the paid product. Stars, forks, issues, and the old URL are preserved by GitHub's transfer redirects, so existing clones and bookmarks keep working. No code or content changes vs 2.1.0 — this release exists solely to publish the org-owned canonical artifact at `releases/latest/download/mypka-scaffold-latest.zip`. (AUTO-175)

### Version files

- `VERSION` → `2.1.2`
- `.scaffold-version` → `2.1.2`

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-19

**Slash commands become adapter-generated.** The `/close-session` command is no longer pre-baked into the scaffold as a Claude-only file. The adapter now generates it at setup time from the canonical close-session protocol in `AGENTS.md`, so the scaffold ships host-neutral and every host gets the right thing: Claude Code gets the slash command, hosts without slash commands skip it and rely on the natural-language triggers. Additive, non-breaking — Claude Code users get the command regenerated idempotently on next activation. (COU-272)

### Added

- **ADAPTER-PROMPT §7-bis "Bind host-native slash commands."** New idempotent setup step: if the host supports native slash commands (Claude Code → `.claude/commands/close-session.md`), the adapter generates `close-session.md` from the canonical close-session protocol in `AGENTS.md`. Hosts without slash commands (Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Cursor, chat-only) skip generation and the tool-specific pointer file notes the natural-language triggers instead. Skip-if-exists — never overwrites a user-customized command file.
- **`SLASH COMMANDS BOUND:` report-back field** in ADAPTER-PROMPT — the adapter now reports whether the close-session command was written, skipped (already exists), or not applicable for the host.

### Removed

- **`.claude/commands/close-session.md` is no longer tracked in the repo.** It was a Claude-Code-only pre-baked file; it is now adapter-generated per §7-bis. Removing it from the scaffold makes the repo host-neutral. (Note: `.claude/agents/*.md` shims are in the same pre-baked-Claude-only category and a candidate for the same treatment — tracked separately, not part of this release.)

### Changed

- `AGENTS.md` (root) — close-session trigger row gains the member-facing phrases "close this session", "wrap", "log this session". The slash-command-optionality line is tightened: `/close-session` is explicitly a Claude-Code-only convenience generated at setup (ADAPTER-PROMPT §7-bis), not required and not shipped; the natural-language triggers are the canonical universal path.
- `validation-script.sh` — `.scaffold-version` check widened from the `2.0.x` line to the full `2.x` line; v2.1.0 introduces no structural changes the script must enforce.

### Version files

- `VERSION` → `2.1.0`
- `.scaffold-version` → `2.1.0`

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-18

**Breaking structural change.** The base scaffold roster moves from **nine specialists to six**. The three creative specialists — Iris (Design System Architect), Charta (Infographic Designer), Pixel (Visual Specialist) — and everything they own come out of the base scaffold and into the optional **Designer Expansion Pack** from the AI Library. The base now ships Larry, Nolan, Pax, Penn, Mack, and Silas. A user updating an existing myPKA from 1.10.x to 2.0.0 loses the three creative agents from their base roster — install the Designer Expansion Pack to keep them. (COU-261)

### Removed

- **Three creative specialists.** `Team/Iris - Design System Architect/`, `Team/Charta - Infographic Designer/`, `Team/Pixel - Visual Specialist/` — agent folders, contracts, and per-agent `journal/` templates.
- **Three Claude sub-agent boot files.** `.claude/agents/iris.md`, `.claude/agents/charta.md`, `.claude/agents/pixel.md`.
- **Four design SOPs.** `SOP-007-build-an-infographic`, `SOP-008-generate-a-styled-image`, `SOP-009-author-a-design-system`, `SOP-010-audit-content-for-design-system-compliance`. The `SOP-007`–`SOP-010` slots are now vacated and reserved; per the no-renumber rule the gap is intentional. A fresh Designer Pack install claims the lowest free slots starting at `SOP-003`.
- **`GL-003-design-system`.** The design-system Guideline (the visual identity SSOT) moves into the Designer Expansion Pack, which now ships it via `adds_guidelines`. It is no longer part of the base Guidelines set.
- **Three team-portrait images.** `github/team/iris.png`, `github/team/charta.png`, `github/team/pixel.png`.

### Changed

- `Team/agent-index.md` — routing table down to six rows; "nine specialists" → "six specialists"; Mack's row drops the Pixel-handoff parenthetical.
- `Team/Larry - Orchestrator/AGENTS.md` — routing cheatsheet drops the four design rows; "What Larry does not do" drops the two design/GL-003 lines.
- `AGENTS.md` (root) — "The team (9 specialists)" → "The team (6 specialists)"; team table down to six rows; "the current 9 specialists" → "6".
- `README.md` — "nine"/"9" roster references → "six"/"6" (×5 including version badge); three creative team-card blocks removed; added a Designer Pack pointer note.
- `WAY-FORWARD.md` — roster lines and the "When … specialists isn't enough" section updated to six; capability list drops infographic layout, image stylization, and design-system authoring (now pack capabilities).
- `Team Knowledge/SOPs/INDEX.md` — four design-SOP rows removed; Reserved line extended to "SOP-003 onward".
- `Team Knowledge/Guidelines/INDEX.md` — `GL-003` row removed; replaced with a Reserved note pointing at the Designer Pack.
- `validation-script.sh` — structural version check moved from the `1.10.x` line to the `2.0.x` line.

### Migration

Updating from 1.10.x to 2.0.0 is **breaking** — the base roster shrinks by three. If you do brand or visual work, install the **Designer Expansion Pack** (Iris, Charta, Pixel + the four design SOPs + `GL-003-design-system`) from the AI Library; it restores the full creative capability as an opt-in pack. Users who do only PKM, journaling, research, automation, or database work need no action — the six-specialist base covers them. Existing session logs that reference the removed agents or SOP-007–010 are left untouched as historical record.

### Version files

- `VERSION` → `2.0.0`
- `.scaffold-version` → `2.0.0`

## [1.10.2] - 2026-05-15

Restores the seeded sample content the myICOR myPKA course walks through. v1.10.x shipped the `PKM/My Life/`, `PKM/CRM/`, `PKM/Documents/`, `PKM/Journal/`, and `PKM/Images/` folders empty (`.gitkeep` placeholders), but the course curriculum references concrete files inside them by name — `morning-build-session.md`, `ship-mvp-by-q3.md`, and others. Learners following along found the files missing and assumed the download was broken. This release closes that gap. No folder structure, schema, or SOP changes — content only, so v1.10.x validation is unaffected.

### Added

- **`PKM/My Life/` concept samples** — one seeded file per subsection: `Topics/ai-tooling.md`, `Habits/morning-build-session.md`, `Goals/ship-mvp-by-q3.md`, `Projects/side-project-mvp.md`, `Key Elements/health.md`. Each is the canonical shape its concept follows and is cross-linked to the others via `[[wikilinks]]`.
- **Per-subfolder `INDEX.md`** for each of the five `My Life` subsections (`Topics/`, `Habits/`, `Goals/`, `Projects/`, `Key Elements/`). The course (lesson "Habits — The Rhythms the Team Supports") references these directly.
- **`PKM/CRM/` samples** — `People/dr-schmidt.md` and `Organizations/dr-schmidt-clinic.md`, the SSOT demo pair the course walks through.
- **`PKM/Documents/passport.md`** — seeded document-stub sample.
- **`PKM/Journal/2026/05/2026-05-04-first-day.md`** — seeded journal entry, the one referenced in the Dr. Schmidt demo.
- **`PKM/Images/2026/05/`** — two seeded sample images (`2026-05-04-dr-schmidt-business-card.png`, `2026-05-04-sample-screenshot.png`), embedded by the CRM and Journal samples.
- **Course-sample banner** — each seeded file opens with an Obsidian `[!example]` callout marking it as a worked sample to adapt or replace, so it is never mistaken for the learner's own content.

### Changed

- `PKM/My Life/INDEX.md`, `PKM/My Life/README.md` — replaced the "ships empty" / "Dean is seeding…" placeholder copy with the actual seeded-sample listing.
- `PKM/Documents/INDEX.md`, `PKM/CRM/INDEX.md`, `PKM/Journal/INDEX.md`, `PKM/Images/INDEX.md` — "Active files" sections now list the seeded samples.

### Trust registry

- `Expansions/.trusted-sources` — pinned `slack@1.0.3` (`sha256=6b5d09ad46328af92e7e6d99706033af2304b13825de00ad391691f617756260`). Slack Expansion v1.0.3 is a packaging/docs-only release (JSON manifest, `slack/` folder rename, `install.sh` quarantine clear); `runtime/index.js` is byte-identical to v1.0.2, so Vex's GREEN audit carries over. Restores the WS-003 §2 trust check to GREEN (silent auto-trust) for v1.0.3 installs. Existing `app-developer@1.0.1` and `slack@1.0.2` entries retained. (AUTO-26)
- Removed `.gitkeep` placeholders from folders that now hold seeded content.

### Version files

- `VERSION` → `1.10.2`
- `.scaffold-version` → `1.10.2`

## [1.10.1] - 2026-05-10

Wires v1.10.0's task system and journal SOPs into the agent contracts. v1.10.0 shipped the folder structure, templates, validation script, and 8 SOPs — but the AGENTS.md files were not updated, which meant the boot-walk and journal-read only happened if the LLM discovered the SOPs on its own. v1.10.1 closes that gap. No new SOPs, no new folders, no new behaviors — only contract-level wiring of what v1.10.0 already shipped.

### Changed

- `Team/Larry - Orchestrator/AGENTS.md` — adds `## Session boot — task-walk first` before `## Three duties`. Larry now walks `Team Knowledge/tasks/open/` + `tasks/in-progress/` per [[SOP-list-open-tasks]] at every session boot and surfaces open priority-1 / in-progress / blocked / stale items in the greeting. Tom no longer has to ask "what's open?" — the team picks up where it left off automatically.
- `Team/Larry - Orchestrator/AGENTS.md` — Duty 1 step 4 (Brief) now requires Larry to create a task via [[SOP-create-task]] before delegating any work that won't finish in-turn, populating all six `linked_*` arrays. The specialist resumes from the task file, not from chat scrollback.
- All 8 specialist AGENTS.md (Nolan, Pax, Penn, Mack, Silas, Charta, Pixel, Iris) — adds a shared `## Task discipline (v1.10.1)` section right after the agent's "When Larry routes to <Name>" section. The block wires three behaviors at dispatch:
  1. Read your `linked_journal_entries` and the matching files in `Team/<your-name>/journal/` per [[SOP-read-own-journal]] before starting work. Auditable via a `## Updates` line that names the priors you carried.
  2. When you create a task, populate all six `linked_*` arrays per [[SOP-create-task]].
  3. When you close a task, write the `## Outcome` and, if there's a durable lesson, write a journal entry per [[SOP-write-journal-entry]] and link it from the closed task.
- `validation-script.sh` — version check loosened from a hard `1.10.0` literal to a `1.10.x` glob so v1.10.x patch releases pass the same structural check. v1.10.0 folders still pass.

### Migration

None required. v1.10.1 is contract-only — no folder structure, schemas, or SOPs change.

### Version files

- `VERSION` → `1.10.1`
- `.scaffold-version` → `1.10.1`

## [1.10.0] - 2026-05-10

Adds task management, per-agent journals, and an LLM-readable migration changelog. Additive — no breaking changes from v1.9.x. v1.9.x folders gain new directories and templates; nothing existing is moved, renamed, or modified.

### Added

- `Team Knowledge/tasks/` — markdown-first task management for unfinished work the team carries across sessions. Folder location encodes status (`open/`, `in-progress/`, `done/<YYYY>/<MM>/`, `cancelled/<YYYY>/<MM>/`). One `.md` file per task. Frontmatter holds six required cross-reference arrays (`linked_sops`, `linked_workstreams`, `linked_guidelines`, `linked_my_life`, `linked_session_logs`, `linked_journal_entries`) so any agent or human reopening a task is one wikilink away from the full working context.
- `Team Knowledge/tasks/_template.md` — starter file for new tasks. Frontmatter schema is locked: every task uses the same fields with the same names so grep, parse, and rebuild are deterministic.
- `Team Knowledge/tasks/INDEX.md` — auto-generated summary view (open by priority, in-progress by assignee, recently closed). Rebuilt at the end of every task-touching SOP and re-checked at session boot.
- `Team Knowledge/tasks/{open,in-progress,done,cancelled}/.gitkeep` — placeholders so empty folders survive in git.
- Task ID scheme: `tsk-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN`. Lexical sort matches chronological sort. Date-prefixed filenames stay self-describing when referenced from session logs months later.
- `Team/<Name> - <Role>/journal/` — per-agent durable insight notes. One folder per shipped specialist (Larry, Nolan, Pax, Penn, Mack, Silas, Charta, Pixel, Iris). The agent commits an entry when they learn something cross-session: a lesson, a decision rule, an anti-pattern. Journal entries are topical, not chronological.
- `Team/<Name> - <Role>/journal/_template.md` — starter file for journal entries. Locked frontmatter (`agent_id`, `type`, `topic`, `tags`, `linked_session_logs`, `linked_tasks`, `related_journal_entries`, `status`).
- `.scaffold-version` — plain-text file at the repo root containing `1.10.0`. Single source of truth for which migrations apply.
- `CHANGELOG-MIGRATION.md` — machine-actionable upgrade spec. Per-version sections with numbered, idempotent recipes any LLM can follow to upgrade an older myPKA folder. Includes a validation script that exits 0 on a structurally valid migration.
- `validation-script.sh` — bash script at the repo root that verifies a folder is v1.10.0-compliant. Exits 0 on success, 1 on failure.
- New SOPs in `Team Knowledge/SOPs/`:
  - `SOP-create-task.md` — confronts all six cross-reference arrays at creation.
  - `SOP-claim-task.md` — atomic claim via `git mv`. Loser retries on a re-list.
  - `SOP-close-task.md` — moves to `done/` with outcome filled in. Surfaces open sub-tasks for explicit decision.
  - `SOP-list-open-tasks.md` — folder walk that Larry runs at session boot.
  - `SOP-rebuild-task-index.md` — awk-based, sub-500ms target on 1,000 tasks.
  - `SOP-write-journal-entry.md` — trigger test, body shape, supersession rules.
  - `SOP-read-own-journal.md` — what each agent runs before starting work on a task.
  - `SOP-write-session-log.md` — extended to reference any tasks created or touched.

### Changed

- `VERSION` bumped from `1.9.0` to `1.10.0`. Minor bump — purely additive, no existing files break.
- Expansions targeting v1.10.0+ should declare `mypka_compat: ">=1.10.0 <2.0.0"`.

### Notes

- Continuity is the principle this release is built on. The team should be able to pick up where it left off across sessions, even when a different specialist takes over. Tasks and journals serve that. There is no lifecycle theater.
- Folder location, frontmatter, and body are redundant on purpose. An agent reading any one of the three can reconstruct enough to act. A grep walker can classify without opening files. A human can `cat` and understand.
- There is no `blocked/` folder. Blocked tasks stay in `in-progress/` with `blocked_reason:` and `blocked_by:` set in frontmatter, so they surface in the assignee's normal queue scan rather than hiding in a folder no one greps.
- Wikilinks use basenames only, never paths. Files can move across folders without breaking links. Same convention as the rest of the scaffold.
- A SQLite mirror for tasks is sketched but deliberately not shipped in v1.10.0. Markdown stays canonical. The existing `SOP-002-convert-mypka-to-sqlite` is the right surface to extend when that need lands.
- Backwards-compatible: v1.9.x Expansions and SOPs continue to work unchanged. The boot routine and per-agent `AGENTS.md` files are unchanged in v1.10.0; the task-walk and journal-read behaviors are codified in the new SOPs and surface naturally as the team discovers them.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-05-09

**Host subagent binding ships out of the box.** First activation now generates host-specific subagent shims so the eight deputies (Penn, Pax, Nolan, Mack, Silas, Charta, Pixel, Iris) can dispatch in parallel via the host's agent runtime — not role-played in a single context. Larry is excluded (he's the main-session identity, not a dispatched subagent).

The contract: **two layers, never three.** The wiki contract at `Team/<Name>/AGENTS.md` is canonical and host-agnostic. The host shim (`.claude/agents/<slug>.md` for Claude Code; `.codex/agents/<slug>.md` for Codex if supported; per-spec for Gemini) is a thin pointer that the host runtime reads to dispatch the specialist. We do NOT add a third layer (e.g. a `CLAUDE.md` inside each `Team/<Name>/`) — that violates SSOT.

### Added

- `.claude/agents/{charta,iris,mack,nolan,pax,penn,pixel,silas}.md` — Claude Code subagent shims for the eight deputies. YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `tools`) + body that points back to the wiki contract via path. ~30-60 lines each. Larry is intentionally excluded.
- `ADAPTER-PROMPT.md` Step 7 (new) — host-agnostic procedure to walk `Team/`, derive each slug, and generate host-specific shims on first init. Per-host matrix: Claude Code → `.claude/agents/`, Codex CLI → `.codex/agents/` (when supported), Gemini CLI → per spec, Cursor / chat-only → noted limitation. **Idempotent** — re-running Step 7 skips any pre-existing shims (never overwrites user customizations). Report-back template adds `HOST SUBAGENT BINDING` field listing written + skipped.

### Changed

- `Team/Nolan - HR/AGENTS.md` — every hire now ships two artifacts: the wiki contract AND the host shim(s) for every host the user has activated. Detection by pointer-file presence (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md.codex`, `GEMINI.md`, `.cursor/rules/main.md`).
- `Team Knowledge/SOPs/SOP-001-how-to-add-a-new-specialist.md` §5 — host-agnostic principle plus host-specific shim path matrix. Two artifacts always go together.
- `VERSION` 1.8.2 → 1.9.0.

### Notes

- No code, schema, or contract changes vs 1.8.x. Host bindings are additive; the wiki contracts are unchanged.
- The `mypka-scaffold-latest.zip` URL pattern is preserved.
- Existing v1.8.x users who upgrade get the eight shims AND the new Step 7 in the next adapter run. The idempotency rule means any manual customizations to existing shim paths are preserved.

## [1.8.2] - 2026-05-09

**Personalization placeholder + Tom-stand-in cleanup.** The scaffold's user-stand-in mentions of "Tom" are replaced with `{{USER_NAME}}` placeholder tokens. `ADAPTER-PROMPT.md` now captures the user's first name on first activation and substitutes the placeholder across the scaffold, saving the value to `PKM/.user.yaml` for future reference. Authorship credits ("Tom builds the system from scratch" video walkthrough) keep the formal name "Dr. Thomas Rödl". App Developer Pack `BUILD-NOTES.md` swept the same way.

### Changed

- `Team/Larry - Orchestrator/AGENTS.md` — "Tom double-clicks `start.command`" → "{{USER_NAME}} double-clicks `start.command`".
- `Team Knowledge/session-logs/_template.md` — example follow-up items "Tom reviews v1" → "{{USER_NAME}} reviews v1".
- `Team Knowledge/Workstreams/WS-003-install-an-expansion.md` — "Tom-approved canonical exception" → "Pre-canonicalized exception".
- `README.md`, `WAY-FORWARD.md` — "Tom builds the system" → "Dr. Thomas Rödl builds the system" (formal authorship credit).
- `ADAPTER-PROMPT.md` — new step 4: detect `{{USER_NAME}}` placeholders, ask user for first name, substitute across the scaffold, save to `PKM/.user.yaml`. Report-back template adds a `PERSONALIZATION` field.
- `AGENTS.md` — new "Personalization" section codifies the substitution rule for future content (e.g., Expansions that ship with `{{USER_NAME}}` tokens).
- App Developer Pack 1.0.1 `BUILD-NOTES.md` — swept "Tom" stand-ins to "the user" / "the maintainer".
- `VERSION` 1.8.1 → 1.8.2.

### Notes

- No code, schema, or contract changes. The `mypka-scaffold-latest.zip` URL pattern is preserved.
- App Developer Pack 1.0.1 manifest hash unchanged (only BUILD-NOTES.md edited; expansion.yaml bytes are identical).

## [1.8.1] - 2026-05-09

**Initial public release.** myPKA ships with a 9-person pre-hired AI team (Larry, Nolan, Pax, Penn, Mack, Silas, Charta, Pixel, Iris), full Personal Knowledge Architecture folder structure (PKM/My Life, PKM/CRM, PKM/Documents, PKM/Journal, PKM/Images), Team Knowledge layer (SOPs, Workstreams, Guidelines, Templates, session-logs), and the Expansions architecture for downloadable agent + connector packs.

### Highlights

- **Plain markdown.** Every note is a `.md` file. Works in Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Cursor, ChatGPT, Obsidian + chat plugin, or any LLM that reads `AGENTS.md`.
- **Session-log triggers (LLM-agnostic).** Natural-language phrases like `close session`, `keep this in mind`, `let's realign` route the team's auto-memory across any LLM — not Claude-only.
- **External knowledge import.** [[WS-002-import-external-knowledge-base]] lets the team pull from Heptabase, Notion, Obsidian, Roam, Logseq, Mem, Capacities, Apple Notes, Evernote, Tana via MCP, or any SQLite-backed PKM tool.
- **Expansions architecture.** Day-1 packs (App Developer Pack, Slack Expansion) ship via the AI Library at [myicor.com](https://myicor.com). [[WS-003-install-an-expansion]] codifies the multi-agent install flow.
- **Frontmatter discipline.** `GL-002` defines field schemas for all eight entity types (Person, Organization, Project, Goal, Habit, Topic, Key Element, Document); `Team Knowledge/Templates/` ships the matching starters.
- **SQLite upgrade path.** [[SOP-002-convert-mypka-to-sqlite]] generates a derived SQLite mirror when the markdown layer outgrows plain files. Markdown stays canonical.
- **Design system primitive.** `GL-003` ships as an empty template; Iris populates it with the user via [[SOP-009-author-a-design-system]] on first creative request, then Charta/Pixel read from it for consistent style.

The `mypka-scaffold-latest.zip` URL pattern is non-negotiable — the myicor.com AI Library download button keeps serving `latest` with zero config changes across releases.
