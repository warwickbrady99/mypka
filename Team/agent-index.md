# Team - Agent Index

Routing table for the twelve specialists in the **v3.0.0 all-in-one** bundle — six base specialists plus six preinstalled from the App Developer Pack (Felix, Vex, Vera) and the Designer Pack (Iris, Charta, Pixel). Larry reads this on every request to decide who handles what.

| Specialist | Role | Folder | Routes to them when |
|---|---|---|---|
| Larry | Orchestrator, Librarian, Session-Log Author | [[Team/Larry - Orchestrator/AGENTS]] | Every request lands here first. Larry never executes domain work; he routes, then synthesizes. |
